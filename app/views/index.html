I also wrote about <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/site-elements/a-flexible-approach-to-responsive-navigation/" rel="external">responsive navigation</a> on Webdesigntuts+. That tutorial is based around <a href="/code/flexmenu/">flexMenu</a>, an open source tool that I wrote.</p>
<p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and sharing what I learn with others through writing, speaking, and collaboration. In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, reading, and going on walks with my wife and our greyhound.</p>
