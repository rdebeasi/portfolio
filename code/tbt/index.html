			<h2></h2>
			<p>I led the front-end development of the new, responsive website for the Tampa Bay Times. Our team of team of developers, designers, editors, and digital strategitsts crafted a new experience that feels at home on any device with a web browser, but is also true to the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning legacy and bold print design.</p>
			<p>I built a CSS framework composed of a resuable content and UI modules that could be combined to make the pages throughout the site. The site is built on a heavily customized version of the <a href="http://www.columnal.com/">Columnal</a> grid system. Columnal provides a 12-column grid that becomes a set of stacked 1-column elements on small devices. I added a third breakpoint for midsize devices such as tablets. At this point, the site is 8 columns wide. Each row is broken up into 4 double-width columns and 8 normal-width columns.</p>
			<p>I also developed a suite of jQuery plugins for the site:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://352media.github.com/flexMenu/">FlexMenu</a> - Responsive navigation bars</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/352Media/flexText">FlexText</a> - for adjusting text's font size based on how it wraps</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/352Media/flexToggle">FlexToggle</a> - Create drawers, expand/collapse boxes, and more. Set it up with one line of JavaScript, then use data attributes to set up all the toggles you'd like.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/rdebeasi/checked-polyfill">Checked Polyfill</a> - Use the :checked pseudo-class in IE7 and IE8.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I loaded JavaScript with the YepNope resource loader, downloading only the files needed by a particular browser. For example, a visitor using Chrome won't have to download IE8 compatibility scripts. This approach also allowed to download JavaScript files in parallel with images and other assets. (Typically, JavaScript files at the top of the page will block the downloading of other assets until they are loaded.)</p>
			<p>Our original designs couldn't account for every possible device and piece of content. When we encountered problems, I designed new layout options on paper or in the browser, rapidly prototyping and testing various approaches. I worked closely with designers and strategists to solve problems and ensure that we remained true to the paper's new look and feel.</p>
			<p>I delivered a set of front-end code for various pages on the site, and developers at the Tampa Bay Times integrated it into their CMS and added features such as carousels. Some elements changed during the integration, and most scripts were not loaded with YepNope. Overall, though, I think we achieved a result that is elegant and future-proof: a website that is true to the design while also being flexible enough to fit a variety of content on a panoply of devices.</p>
